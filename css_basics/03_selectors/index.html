      DESCENDANT SELECTOR - We just use a blank space to select the descendant of an element.
      In this case we are selecting the p, which is a descendant of the article element.
      For this reason, when we are reading a css selector we shout try to read it from right to left.
      In this case we would read "all the p which are descendants of article".
      The level DOES NOT MATTER - If we have a p inside of a div (had to change the code to be another element - section), although it is not a direct child of article, it is still a descendant.

      GENERAL SIBLING SELECTOR - Selects all the siblings of an element, not only if it is next to it.
      In this case we want all the p that are general siblings of the h2. 
      The order of the code matters, otherwise we would change the color of all the p that are at the same level of the h2.
      Like this we only consider the ones that come after the h2.

      PSEUDO-CLASS SELECTOR - This one will be used a lot. Some elements on html have behaviors.
      Different behaviors when we select the input, when we hover over and we can control this with pseudo-class selectors.

    <h1>Main Heading</h1>

      This paragraph is adjacent to h1 and demonstrates the adjacent sibling
      selector.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is a regular paragraph showing the type selector. Since with
      selecting by type we need to write the p element itself we've just set the
      margin and padding.
    </p>

    <p class="highlight">
      This paragraph has a highlight class, demonstrating the class selector.
    </p>

    <input type="text" placeholder="Enter text here" />

      <section>
        <p>
          This paragraph is inside of a section element, which is inside of an
          article. Although it is not a direct child it still gets the same
          formatting.

    <p>
      This is a sibling paragraph to h2, demonstrating the general sibling
      selector.

    <div>This is a sibling div to h2.</div>
    <p>This is another sibling paragraph to h2.</p>

      line and first letter.

    <h3>Heading 3</h3>
